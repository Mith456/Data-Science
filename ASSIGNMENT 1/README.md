# FOCUS OF ASSIGNMENT 1
The sole focus of this assignment is to implement Regression in Python. Assignment presents following homework problems.

## Homeowork1: Weighted Linear Regression

## Homework 2: Prediction of Boston House Pricing data
The dataset deals with 13 predictors and a response variable: Median value of owner occupied homes in $1000.
The objective of this mini-project is as follows:
1) Identify the first three strongest correlation pairs and plot of correlation between all input variables and response variable.
2) Conduct the simple regression of response variable with all predictors. Split the data into training and testing and evaluate the testing accuracy of each model.
3) Conduct Multiple Regression and provide an estimate of it's testing accuracy.

## Homework 3: Polynomial Regression Model
For a true sine function, generate training samples and fit this function with a polynomial model. Follwing tasks includes:

1) Generate the Design Matrix for the polynomial model.

2) Use simulation to compute the bias and variance for polynomial model from order 1 to 20.
