# ASSIGNMENT 2
The sole focus of this assignment is Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, Gradient descent, BIC, Cross-validation

## HOMEWORK1
 Loss function: min β,l(β) = ||(y−Xβ)||**2 + λ||β||2** 2
 Goal: Implement Gradient descent optimization on Ridge Regression

## HOMEWORK2
Combine Ridge regression by fitting polynomial regression of order 10, for the sine function in HW1.

## HOMEWORK3
Implement Lasso and Ridge Regression on House Pricing dataset
